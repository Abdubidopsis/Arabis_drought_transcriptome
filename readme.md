# 🌱 Arabis Drought Transcriptome

This repository contains supplemental data and scripts associated with the analysis of transcriptomic responses to drought stress in *Arabis* species (*A. sagittata* and *A. nemorensis*).

## 🧪 Project Description
This study explores how closely related *Arabis* species respond to drought stress at the molecular level.  
It includes:
- High-resolution transcriptome analysis
- Differential gene expression and functional enrichment
- miRNA–target interactions (with a focus on miR408)
- Expression Predictive Motifs (EPMs) discovered using machine learning
- Comparative analysis of regulatory elements across species
