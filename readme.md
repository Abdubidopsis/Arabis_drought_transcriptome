# Arabis Drought Transcriptome

This repository contains supplemental data and scripts associated with the analysis of transcriptomic responses to drought stress in Arabis species.

## üß™ Project Description

This study explores the differential gene expression and regulatory patterns in **Arabis sagittata** and **Arabis nemorensis** under drought stress. It includes high-resolution transcriptome analysis, Expression prediction and enrichments, and exploration of miRNA-target interactions.
